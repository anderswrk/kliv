## Introduction

At Kliv, we believe in being transparent about how we handle your data. This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have about your data when using our AI-powered app building platform at kliv.dev.

This policy works together with our Terms of Service and applies to everyone who uses Kliv. We've written this in plain language because we want you to actually read and understand it.

## What Information We Collect

### Your Account Information

- Your email address and name
- Payment details for premium features
- Your account settings and preferences

### How You Use Kliv

- The prompts you write and code we generate
- Which features you use and how often

## How We Use Your Information

### Making Kliv Better

We use your data to improve our platform, train our AI models (except for Enterprise users), and add new features that make building apps even easier.

### Keeping Things Running

We process your information to provide customer support, handle payments, send important updates, and keep our platform secure and running smoothly.

### Analytics and Insights

We use PostHog and Google Analytics to understand how people use Kliv. This helps us identify what's working well and what needs improvement. You can opt out of Google Analytics using their browser add-on.

## When We Share Your Data

### Trusted Partners

We work with carefully selected service providers who help us run Kliv. They only get access to the data they need to do their job, and they're required to protect your information just like we do.

### Enterprise Protection

Enterprise customers get extra protection. We don't use Enterprise data for AI training, and we have stricter controls on data sharing. Check our Terms of Service for full details.

### Your Project Visibility

Your projects are private by default. Only you and authorized Kliv team members can see them. If you make a project public, other users can view and remix it. You're always in control of what you share.

## Your Privacy Rights

You have control over your data. Here's what you can do:

- View and download your personal information
- Correct any inaccurate data
- Delete your account and data
- Export your projects and code
- Opt out of certain data processing
- Withdraw your consent at any time

To exercise any of these rights, just email us at feedback@kliv.dev

## How We Protect Your Data

We take security seriously and use industry-standard measures to protect your information:

- All data is encrypted when transmitted and stored
- Strict access controls limit who can see your data
- Regular security audits and monitoring
- Our team is trained on data protection best practices

While we do everything we can to protect your data, no system is 100% secure. You can help by keeping your account credentials safe and letting us know if you notice anything suspicious.
