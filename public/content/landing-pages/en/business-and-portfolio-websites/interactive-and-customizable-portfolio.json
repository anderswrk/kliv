      "content": "## Rise above the templates\n\nMany professionals rely on standard portfolio platforms or basic website builders. While convenient, these often lead to:\n\n- **Homogenized designs**: Your portfolio looks like everyone else's, making it hard to be memorable.\n- **Limited interactivity**: Static images and text don't convey your dynamic capabilities.\n- **Branding restrictions**: Your site might not fully align with your personal or professional brand identity.\n- **Data ownership issues**: You might not have full control over your content or analytics data.\n- **Unnecessary features**: Paying for bloated platforms with features you'll never use.\n\n## Why custom-built is your ultimate advantage\n\nBuilding your own interactive portfolio with Kliv lets you break free from these limitations, offering unparalleled flexibility and distinctiveness:\n\n### Perfect brand alignment\nEvery pixel, every animation, every interaction can be meticulously crafted to reflect your unique personal brand, professional style, and creative vision. You're not just showing your work; you're embodying your identity.\n\n### Unrestricted creativity & interactivity\nEnvision a portfolio that's more than just static images.
