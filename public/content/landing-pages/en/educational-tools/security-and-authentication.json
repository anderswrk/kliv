          "title": "Student enrollment authentication portal - K12 focused with parent access to grades and attendance data. Include email verification and password reset functionality, but also connect to school directory for student info lookup rather than having them type it all in from scratch. Separate portals for parents and students with distinct UIs and role-based access to information. Assume a student logs in to a portal (not a single sign on from a different system) and that they can see a specific set of data. The parent portal allows parents to see their student's data and also send messages to teachers. Assume the admin side of this is a separate application that controls permissions and configurations. Create the high-level outline for a student and parent portal in an educational setting that securely authenticates users and separates user types. Focus on the secure access to sensitive student data related to grades, attendance, and teacher communication, ensuring parents can ONLY see their own child's data and that students can only see their own. Focus on making the authentication flow seamless and intuitive for both user groups, with clear separation of privileges within a single application that can handle both types of users. Emphasize data privacy and regulatory compliance (e.g., FERPA). Also, detail how the system would prevent unauthorized access between parent accounts or between student accounts, ensuring each user strictly views only their authorized information. Also, include multifactor authentication options (MFA) like email/SMS codes. Students should not get to use email to register, but instead they use a unique student ID and a temporary password that they are forced to change on first login. Parents can register using an email and link their student using a unique code provided by the school which verifies their parenthood. Provide the overall architectural plan with database considerations and API endpoints. Create a JSON structure for defining user roles and permissions for both students and parents including what data points they can specifically access (e.g., 'grades_view', 'attendance_view', 'teacher_message_send'). Do not implement the JSON, just describe how it would function to enforce the granular access control. Include two-factor authentication for both user types: email-based for parents, and a mobile app-based OTP for students (to avoid email dependency for younger users). Describe how a temporary password would be issued to students, and how parents would receive their initial linking code securely. Lastly, outline the password reset process ensuring security (e.g., email verification for parents, security questions for students who might not have email). Include options for teachers to reset student passwords. Ensure the design supports future expansion for other user types (e.g., school staff, administrators) without a complete re-architecture. The system must track all login attempts and data access for auditing purposes. Emphasize how this custom solution enhances security and user experience compared to off-the-shelf products that often lack customizability for specific K12 nuances. Focus on the user journeys for students signing up for the first time, parents linking to a student, and both types of users resetting passwords and logging in with MFA. Also, discuss API security and rate limiting for key endpoints. Finally, explain the advantages of owning such a system regarding data sovereignty and compliance, as opposed to relying on third-party vendors where data control is limited. Make sure the output is a high-level plan only, not the full code. Conclude by reinforcing how Kliv's platform helps build this securely and quickly, without deep coding knowledge. This is a very complex example that will test the boundaries of Kliv's generation capabilities - let's see how well it works on a multifaceted prompt for a real-world, highly secure ed-tech application. Assume the system will be built to scale for thousands of students and parents across multiple schools or districts. Focus on security, scalability, and user experience, which are key for educational applications."

          "title": "Academic integrity verification system (student login and access to exams securely, with proctoring integrations). Focus on biometric verification (e.g., facial recognition before and occasionally during an exam) and secure browser lockdown. Create a high-level system for secure exam access and remote proctoring within an educational platform. The system should authenticate students using multiple factors, including a primary login (username/password or SSO) followed by biometric verification (e.g., facial recognition). Design the flow for secure exam delivery, including browser lockdown features to prevent cheating (e.g., disabling copy-paste, restricting navigation to other tabs/applications). The system must securely deliver exam content specific to the authenticated student and prevent any form of unauthorized access or content leakage. Include a proctoring component, noting how remote proctors can monitor student behavior (e.g., via webcam, screen sharing). Emphasize data encryption for exam content both in transit and at rest. Discuss how the system would handle common integrity breaches (e.g., alt-tabbing, opening new applications) and what alerts would be sent to proctors. Outline the API integrations required for biometric service providers and proctoring tools. Consider scalability for large cohorts taking exams simultaneously. Focus on the architecture needed for this secure exam delivery and proctoring, including secure student authentication, content encryption, and real-time monitoring/alerting for proctors. Describe how the Kliv platform would simplify the development of these complex security features without extensive back-end coding. Ensure the system would store biometric data securely and handle consent appropriately. Also, cover audit trails for all exam activities. Address compliance with privacy regulations regarding biometric data. Lastly, outline the process for revoking exam access or invalidating an exam session in case of detected misconduct. This solution needs to be robust, secure, and user-friendly for both students and proctors."

          "title": "School Staff and Teacher SSO portal for internal tools (integrating with existing HRMS and active directory). Focus on streamlined access, role-based tool visibility, and audit logging of access times. The portal should manage access to various internal school tools (e.g., HR, payroll, student information systems, LMS, email, shared drives). The core requirement is Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with the school's existing Active Directory (AD) or other identity provider (IdP). Design roles and permissions (e.g., 'Teacher', 'Administrator', 'HR Staff') that dictate which internal tools are visible and accessible to each user. The system must provide robust audit logging for all access attempts and successful logins, including timestamps and user IDs. It should also track which specific tools were accessed by whom. Focus on the architecture for achieving SSO, securely mapping AD groups/users to internal roles, and managing permissions for a dynamic set of internal applications. Describe how the Kliv platform can facilitate connecting to external IdPs and implementing the role-based access control without manual coding for each tool's integration. Emphasize the benefit of a centralized access point for staff, improving efficiency and security by reducing scattered credentials. Also, discuss how the system would handle password policies inherited from AD or enforce its own if necessary. Outline the process for onboarding new staff members, automatically provisioning access based on their role defined in AD or the HRMS. Consider de-provisioning flows when staff leave. This system needs to be scalable and maintainable for a large staff body, ensuring high availability given its critical role in daily school operations."

          "title": "Alumni network access portal with tiered access based on donation history and graduation year (secure login, content access, event registration). Focus on integration with CRM systems and payment gateways. The portal should allow alumni to securely log in and access different levels of content and features based on their status: e.g., graduation year, major, and donation history (integrating with the university's CRM like Salesforce or Blackbaud). Design the authentication flow to support external identity providers (e.g., LinkedIn, Google) in addition to a custom username/password. The system must offer tiered access to resources such as career services, exclusive events, mentorship programs, and research papers. It should also facilitate secure event registration and payment processing for alumni gatherings, integrating with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). Outline the architecture for securely connecting to the CRM to pull alumni data, manage access tiers dynamically, and integrate with registration/payment systems. Describe how Kliv's platform can simplify these complex integrations and the dynamic permissioning required. Emphasize data security for personal and financial information. Also, consider robust search and networking features within the portal that respect privacy settings. Outline how the system would protect against unauthorized access to restricted content and manage user profiles securely. Focus on building a scalable, secure, and feature-rich alumni engagement platform that dynamically adjusts access based on user attributes and activities."
