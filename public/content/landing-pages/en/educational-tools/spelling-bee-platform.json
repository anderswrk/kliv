Generic spelling bee apps often come with fixed word lists, limited customization, and subscription models that don't fit every budget. Building your own platform gives you unparalleled flexibility, control, and ownership. With AI-assisted development, you can create a system that perfectly aligns with your curriculum, teaching style, and student needs, without deep technical expertise."
