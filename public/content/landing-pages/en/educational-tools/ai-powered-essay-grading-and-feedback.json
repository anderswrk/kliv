      "content": "For educators, providing meaningful feedback on student essays is crucial for learning, but it's also incredibly time-consuming. Juggling large class sizes, diverse student needs, and administrative tasks often leaves teachers with limited time to offer the specific, personalized guidance students need to improve their writing.\n\nGeneric grading software often falls short, providing shallow analyses or rigid rubrics that don't capture the nuances of student work. This leaves teachers feeling overwhelmed and students receiving feedback that isn't truly helpful."
