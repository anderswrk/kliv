While generic language apps exist, they often fail to cater to specific pedagogical approaches, niche learner groups (e.g., business English, academic English), or unique interactive features.\n\nBuilding your own English learning platform allows you to create a highly specialized and branded educational product. With AI-powered development, you can integrate cutting-edge features like AI tutors, personalized content generation, and advanced analytics, providing a competitive edge over off-the-shelf solutions."
