A custom application can easily be updated to include new asset classes, incorporate new analytical models, or integrate with emerging financial services, without dependency on a vendor's update schedule.\n\n## Real-world applications\n\nCustom investment tracking tools can serve a variety of needs:\n\n**Personal Investors**: Consolidate all brokerage, crypto, and alternative investments into one dashboard to visualize true net worth and asset allocation.\n\n**Family Offices**: Manage complex portfolios across multiple entities and generations, with custom reporting for tax planning and intergenerational wealth transfer.\n\n**Financial Advisors**: Create bespoke client dashboards that show performance tailored to individual financial plans, integrating unique benchmarks and risk metrics.\n\n**Niche Asset Holders**: Track illiquid assets like real estate, private equity, or collectibles alongside traditional investments, with custom valuation methodologies.\n\nThe AI advantage\n\nBuilding sophisticated financial software used to be a daunting task. Kliv's AI-powered platform simplifies the process:\n\n-   **Natural Language Interface**: Describe your desired features and the AI assists in generating the application.\n-   **Rapid Prototyping**: See a working version of your tracker in hours, allowing for quick iterations.\n-   **Intelligent Data Handling**: AI can suggest optimal ways to connect to data sources and structure your financial information.\n-   **Automated Testing**: Ensure accuracy and reliability, crucial for financial applications.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe most effective investment management tool is one that truly works for you.
