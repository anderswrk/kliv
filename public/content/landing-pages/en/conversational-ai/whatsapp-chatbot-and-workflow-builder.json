      "content": "In today’s mobile-first world, businesses need to be where their customers are. With over 2 billion users, WhatsApp is a dominant communication channel. Custom-built WhatsApp chatbots and conversational workflows are no longer a luxury – they are a necessity for seamless customer engagement and efficient operations.\n\nOff-the-shelf chatbot solutions often come with limitations: rigid flows, generic responses, and expensive usage-based pricing. Building your own gives you complete control, full customization, and cost efficiency, especially for businesses with high volumes of conversations. Kliv's AI-powered platform makes this accessible even without deep technical expertise."
