      "type": "text",
      "content": "The mobile gaming market is saturated with apps, but it's also hungry for fresh, engaging casual experiences. While publishing through existing platforms means giving up significant revenue shares and control, building your own empowers you with full ownership, direct player relationships, and complete creative freedom. Off-the-shelf game engines often come with prohibitive licensing fees or complexities that are overkill for simple, addictive games. With Kliv, you can quickly iterate on game ideas, test player engagement, and optimize for retention, all while owning your intellectual property from day one."

      "content": "## Beyond the App Store Cut\n\nExisting app stores take a hefty percentage of your revenue, sometimes up to 30%. Building your own platform, even if deployed through app stores, gives you the core technology to bypass these fees for direct sales, subscriptions, or future ventures. Imagine a dedicated web platform for your games or direct-to-consumer distribution.\n\n## Unmatched Flexibility and Monetization\n\nWith a custom platform, you dictate the monetization strategy: ads, in-app purchases (IAPs), subscriptions, or a hybrid. You're not restricted by a platform's rules or forced into methods that don't fit your game. Want to introduce a unique seasonal event mechanic? Easy. Want to offer custom premium content? No problem.\n\n### Direct Player Relationships\n\nUnderstand your players better with direct analytics and communication channels. Build a community around your games, gather feedback directly, and foster loyalty without intermediaries. This data is invaluable for iterative development and long-term success.\n\n### Rapid Prototyping and Iteration\n\nKliv's platform allows for incredibly fast development cycles. Turn an idea into a playable prototype in days, not months. This agility is crucial for casual games, where trends can shift quickly. Test a new mini-game, deploy it, analyze engagement, and decide its future with real player data.\n\n### Future-Proofing Your IP\n\nYour game concepts, code, and player data are entirely yours. This means you have the foundation to expand, license, or evolve your platform into a major gaming hub without external dependencies or restrictions. Think beyond a single game ‚Äì foster an ecosystem of engaging content.\n\n## Real-World Potential\n\n- **Hyper-casual collections**: A single app housing dozens of simple, endlessly replayable games with a unified player progression system.\n- **Brain training apps**: Games designed to improve focus, memory, or problem-solving, often with subscription models for advanced content.\n- **Competitive puzzle games**: Timed puzzles or matching games with global leaderboards and tournament features.\n- **Interactive story apps**: Choose-your-own-adventure style games with decision points that affect outcomes, monetized through chapter unlocks.\n- **Art/design mini-games**: Simple drawing, coloring, or design challenges where users can share creations and unlock new tools through IAPs."
