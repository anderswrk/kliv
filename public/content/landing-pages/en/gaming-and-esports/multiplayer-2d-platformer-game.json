      "content": "Developing a multiplayer game, especially a real-time platformer, comes with unique complexities. Beyond designing compelling levels and mechanics, you need to handle server infrastructure, network synchronization, player authentication, matchmaking, and data persistence. These technical hurdles often push indie developers away from realizing their vision.\n\nTraditional game development often involves significant upfront time and resources building out this complex backend, taking focus away from what truly matters: making a fun and engaging game. Kliv offers a streamlined path to bring your multiplayer 2D platformer to life, handling the heavy lifting so you can concentrate on creativity and gameplay."
