      "content": "## The problem with scattered game collections\n\nModern gaming means games are spread across Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation, and even classic emulators. This fragmentation leads to:\n\n- **Difficulty finding games**: \"Which platform was that game on again?\"\n- **Lack of overview**: No single place to see your entire collection.\n- **Missing data**: No unified way to track playtime, completion status, or personal notes.\n- **Limited discovery**: Generic storefront recommendations don't always align with your specific tastes.\n- **Data privacy concerns**: Sharing your entire gaming history with various third parties.\n\n## Why a custom solution is a game-changer\n\nBuilding your own game library management tool isn't just about convenience; it's about empowerment. With Kliv, you can create a system that:\n\n### Unifies your entire collection\nImport games from all your platforms into one central database. Whether it's PC, console, or retro titles, everything lives in one place.\n\n### Tracks what truly matters to you\nCustomize fields to track playtime, completion rates, personal ratings, notes, desired achievements, or even custom tags like 'couch co-op' or 'story-rich adventure'.\n\n### Personalizes game discovery\nLeverage your existing library data to build a recommendation engine that suggests games based on your actual preferences, not just what a publisher wants to promote.\n\n### Provides total data ownership\nYour game data, your rules. Host your application yourself, ensuring your personal gaming habits remain private and secure.\n\n### Evolves with your gaming habits\nAs you discover new ways to play or new features you desire, you can easily modify and expand your application without waiting for a third-party update or paying for premium features.\n\n## Real-world applications for gamers\n\nImagine possibilities beyond simple lists:\n\n**Curated game review hub**: A personal system where you not only list games but also write and save your reviews, link to external articles, and track critical reception.\n\n**Achievement/Trophy tracker**: An application that pulls your achievement data and helps you prioritize which games to play next based on your completionist goals.\n\n**Multiplayer session planner**: Track which friends own which games, plan online sessions, and even integrate with Discord to coordinate.\n\n**Retro game emulator frontend**: A visually rich frontend for your emulated game ROMs, complete with box art, descriptions, and launch capabilities.\n\n## Building with the power of AI\n\nKliv leverages AI to simplify complex development. You describe the features you want, and the AI assists in generating the underlying structure and logic:\n\n- **Natural language interface**: Describe your desired features in plain English.\n- **Component generation**: AI helps create the database models, user interfaces, and API integrations.\n- **Iterative development**: Rapidly build and test new features, refining your app as you go.\n- **Smart integrations**: AI can suggest and help implement connections to gaming APIs or data sources.\n\nYour passion for gaming deserves a tool built with that same passion. Stop settling for less and start building your custom game library today."
