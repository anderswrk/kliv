      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "## The limitations of existing games\n\nMany popular football manager games, while excellent, come with inherent restrictions:\n\n- **Fixed feature sets**: Developers dictate what you can and can't do.\n- **Subscription models**: Often require recurring payments for full access.\n- **Limited multiplayer**: True head-to-head global league play is rare, often relying on unofficial setups.\n- **Data ownership**: You don't own your game data or player profiles.\n- **Modding limitations**: Customization is often restricted to pre-defined tools.\n\n## The advantages of a bespoke solution\n\nDeveloping your own multiplayer football manager game gives you unparalleled control and flexibility:\n\n### Unrestricted game mechanics\nImagine a transfer market with dynamic AI agents, a youth academy system based on real-world scouting parameters, or tactical depth never before seen. Your rules, your vision.\n\n### Full control over monetization\nImplement unique revenue streams, from battle passes to cosmetic items, without revenue sharing agreements or platform limitations. Build a sustainable model that rewards both players and developers.\n\n### True global multiplayer experiences\nSeamlessly integrate real-time leagues, cup competitions, and friendlies against other human managers worldwide. Design seasons, promotion/relegation, and even international manager roles.\n\n### Ownership of your IP and data\nAll game logic, player data, and user profiles are yours. This is crucial for future expansions, data analytics, and protecting your investment.\n\n### Community-driven development\nEngage directly with your player base to evolve the game. Implement features requested by your community, fostering stronger loyalty and growth.\n\n## Practical applications and examples\n\nA custom-built football manager game isn't just a passion project; it's a viable business:\n\n- **Esports leagues**: Create a platform that supports competitive esports leagues with prize pools and global rankings.\n- **Niche clubs/leagues**: Focus on specific leagues, historic eras, or fictional football worlds that appeal to a dedicated audience.\n- **Educational tools**: Use the simulation aspects to teach real-world football strategy or financial management.\n- **Content creation hub**: Integrate streaming tools, commentary features, and easily exportable match highlights for content creators.\n\n## The Kliv advantage\n\nBuilding a complex multiplayer game used to be a monumental task. Kliv's AI platform simplifies this process significantly:\n\n- **Rapid prototyping**: Quickly iterate on game mechanics and UIs.\n- **Backend generation**: Automatically create scalable databases for players, teams, and match data.\n- **Real-time capabilities**: Tools for handling concurrent user actions, match simulations, and live updates.\n- **Scalable infrastructure**: Build a game that can handle thousands, even millions, of concurrent users.\n\nWith Kliv, you're not just 'making a game'; you're architecting an entire football management ecosystem tailored to your ambitions."
