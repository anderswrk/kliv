While general-purpose search engines are powerful for broad queries, they fall short when you need to navigate specialized data, internal documents, or highly specific web content.\n\nOff-the-shelf search solutions often impose limitations on indexing, ranking, and user experience. They might index data you don't care about, miss crucial content within your domain, or lack the custom filtering and display options your users truly need. Building your own custom search engine with Kliv puts you in control, allowing for unparalleled precision and relevance."
