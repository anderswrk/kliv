      "content": "## The limitations of existing platforms\n\nExisting large-scale music streaming platforms are designed for the masses. While convenient, they often come with significant drawbacks for creators, niche communities, or businesses looking to offer specialized audio content:\n\n- **Generic user experience:** One-size-fits-all means not catering to specific aesthetic or functional preferences.\n- **Content restrictions:** Limited control over content curation, monetization, or integration with external artist tools.\n- **High fees/royalties:** Substantial cuts taken from creators or high subscription costs for users.\n- **Branding dilution:** Your content is just one among millions, with limited ability for unique branding.\n- **Missing niche features:** Unable to implement specialized functionalities required by a particular genre, community, or use case.\n\n## The power of bespoke audio experiences\n\nBuilding your own mobile music application using modern AI development tools unlocks unparalleled advantages:\n\n### Full creative control\nDesign an interface, features, and content ecosystem that perfectly aligns with your vision.
