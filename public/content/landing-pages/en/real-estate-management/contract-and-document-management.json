      "content": "## The Limitations of Off-the-Shelf Systems\n\nExisting document management platforms, while broad in scope, rarely cater precisely to the intricacies of real estate:\n\n- **Lack of Industry-Specific Fields**: Generic systems don't have built-in fields for property IDs, tenant names, lease expiry dates, or inspection schedules.\n- **Poor Integration Capabilities**: Difficulty connecting with property management software, CRM, or accounting systems.\n- **Security Overheads**: Storing sensitive real estate financial and personal data in a generic cloud might not meet specific regional compliance standards.\n- **Scalability Issues**: As your portfolio grows, many solutions become cumbersome or prohibitively expensive.\n- **Version Control Headaches**: Managing numerous amendments to leases or purchase agreements can become a nightmare without proper versioning.\n\n## The Power of Custom-Built for Real Estate\n\nAI-powered platforms like Kliv empower you to create a bespoke document management system that offers significant advantages:\n\n### Unparalleled Security and Compliance\nDesign your system with industry-specific security protocols and data residency requirements in mind.
