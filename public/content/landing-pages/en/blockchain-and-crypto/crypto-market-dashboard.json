      "content": "## Limitations of off-the-shelf crypto trackers\n\nExisting crypto market dashboards and portfolio trackers often come with significant drawbacks:\n\n-   **Generic views**: They offer one-size-fits-all perspectives that might not highlight the metrics most crucial to your decisions.\n-   **Data overload**: Too much irrelevant information can obscure key signals.\n-   **Limited integrations**: Difficulty connecting to all your exchanges, wallets, and specific APIs.\n-   **Privacy concerns**: Sharing your portfolio and trading data with third-party platforms creates security risks.\n-   **Subscription costs**: Fees can add up, especially for advanced features.\n\n## The advantages of a DIY approach\n\nLeveraging AI platforms like Kliv to build your own crypto dashboard provides significant benefits:\n\n### Tailored to your strategy\n\nWhether you're a day trader, HODLer, or DeFi enthusiast, your dashboard can be designed to display precisely the data points that inform your unique strategy. Visualize specific trading pairs, custom indicators, or aggregated portfolio views across multiple platforms.\n\n### Complete data control & privacy\n\nKeep your sensitive portfolio data private. You decide where your data lives and how it's accessed, mitigating risks associated with third-party data breaches or privacy policy changes.\n\n### Real-time, relevant insights\n\nIntegrate directly with the APIs of the exchanges and data sources you trust to get truly real-time data. Filter out noise and focus on what matters most for your market analysis.\n\n### Cost-effective in the long run\n\nAvoid recurring subscription fees. A custom-built solution is a one-time investment that serves your needs indefinitely, allowing you to reallocate funds to your crypto investments.\n\n### Evolving with the market\n\nThe crypto space is constantly innovating. Your custom dashboard can evolve with it. Easily add support for new coins, integrate with emerging DeFi protocols, or incorporate new analytical models as your needs change.\n\n## Real-world applications\n\nCustom crypto dashboards can serve various sophisticated needs:\n\n**Arbitrage opportunity monitoring**: A dashboard showing price discrepancies across multiple exchanges for specific trading pairs.\n\n**DeFi portfolio tracker**: Aggregating staked assets, liquidity pool positions, and yield farming returns from various decentralized protocols.\n\n**NFT floor price tracking**: Monitoring average sale prices and volume for specific NFT collections across marketplaces.\n\n**Sentiment analysis dashboard**: Pulling data from social media and news feeds to gauge market sentiment for particular assets.\n\n**Tax reporting aid**: Consolidating transaction history from multiple sources for easier tax calculation and reporting.\n\n## The power of AI in building your tool\n\nBuilding complex data applications used to require deep programming knowledge. Kliv's AI platform democratizes this process:\n\n-   **Natural language interface**: Describe the dashboard you envision in plain English.\n-   **Rapid iteration**: See your dashboard take shape quickly, allowing for immediate feedback and adjustments.\n-   **Intelligent data integration**: AI assists in connecting to various crypto APIs and structuring the data.\n-   **Smart visualization**: Get recommendations for effective charts and graphs to represent your data.\n\nInvest in a tool that truly empowers your crypto journey. A custom dashboard built with Kliv gives you the clarity and control you need to navigate the volatile crypto landscape."
