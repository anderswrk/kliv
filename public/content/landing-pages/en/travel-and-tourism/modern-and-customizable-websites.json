      "content": "## The limitations of off-the-shelf travel sites\n\nMany travel businesses resort to pre-made website themes or SaaS platforms. While seemingly convenient, these often lead to:\n\n- **Identical designs**: Blending into the crowd with websites that look just like your competitors'.\n- **Limited flexibility**: Inability to integrate specific booking engines, unique content formats, or custom features vital for your business model.\n- **Suboptimal user experience**: Forced navigation paths and slow loading times that frustrate potential customers.\n- **Recurring, escalating costs**: Monthly fees dictated by platform providers, often increasing with usage or features.\n- **Data silos**: Difficulty integrating booking data with CRM, marketing analytics, or accounting systems.\n\n## Why custom-built delivers a superior journey\n\nKliv revolutionizes website development, making custom solutions accessible to travel businesses of all sizes.
