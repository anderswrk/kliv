Traditional sign-in and onboarding processes are often cumbersome, data-hungry, and visually cluttered. Building your own system allows you to prioritize a clean aesthetic, essential functionality, and a reduced digital footprint, aligning your brand with conscious values."

      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "## Beyond Just Aesthetics\n\nMinimalism is more than just a trend; it's a philosophy focused on simplicity, clarity, and essentialism. When applied to user experience, it strips away distractions, reduces cognitive load, and enhances usability. Furthermore, an eco-friendly approach extends this mindfulness to the digital infrastructure itself.\n\n### Benefits of a Minimalist Approach:\n\n*   **Improved User Experience:** Clean interfaces reduce clutter, making forms and steps easier to understand and complete.\n*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Users aren't overwhelmed with choices or extraneous information, leading to higher completion rates.\n*   **Faster Loading Times:** Lighter designs often mean less data transfer, benefiting users on slower connections and reducing server load.\n*   **Enhanced Brand Perception:** Associates your brand with clarity, sophistication, and user-centricity.\n*   **Lower Maintenance:** Simpler designs are typically easier to maintain and update.\n\n### Embracing Eco-Friendly Principles:\n\nWhile software itself isn't tangible, its execution has an environmental impact. An eco-friendly approach to digital design focuses on:\n\n*   **Data Minimization:** Collecting only essential data reduces storage needs and the energy associated with managing large datasets.\n*   **Efficient Code & Design:** Optimized code and lightweight visuals require less processing power, leading to lower energy consumption on servers and user devices.\n*   **Transparency & Trust:** Openly communicating about data practices and digital sustainability builds user trust.\n*   **Sustainability Messaging:** Integrates your brand's commitment to the environment directly into the user journey.\n\n## Real-World Impact\n\nImagine a wellness app where the sign-up process feels calming, not chaotic. Or an ethical fashion e-commerce site where the onboarding emphasizes your sustainable practices from the first click, rather than burying it in a privacy policy. These custom experiences are not just marketing; they are integral to your brand identity."

          "title": "Mindful Meditation App Onboarding Flow with Data Privacy Focus and Eco-Tips on Each Step for the User to Read as System Loads up the next step or the next tab opens up for the user to visit it, The System Can Take the User Email and Username Only, The user Can Enter Their Profile Photo Later, The system Can Only Take Their Name and Location for now until they enter it and if they provide it it appears on their profile but if they don't the field remains blank, The System Should use a Minimalistic look and theme and be fully functional, it should also be mobile responsive and mobile friendly, It needs to have a Home Page With a Welcome to the app Message For the User That's Currently Logged In It should also have a logout Button for the User To log out from the system when they are done so that the app will not store Their Credentials on the Main Page of the app and or the Homepage, The homepage should also have a settings button for the User to open the settings of the app and apply changes to the app from the settings menu and save them. No Comments Should Appear on the Code. The Code Must be Written in Python With the Flask Framework. The Python Code Must be Fully Functional and Have a Minimalist UI. The Flask Python App Should be Fully Working and Mobile Friendly. The Database that the App Will Use to Store The Users Credentials Will be SQLite. The App Can also be Called EcoMeditation as an Example. The Login and Registration Pages should also have a minimalist look and feel, The app will allow the user to view other user profiles (But Not View Their Information) it will be like the profile is empty (Just the name and a picture that they already uploaded) on the profile of the users so that the privacy of the users will be mainted in the app so that no data loss will occur on the user accounts on the app, A user should not be able to follow another user on the app and or send messages to other users of the app, The only thing that users can do on the app is to meditate and view their profile settings. A user should be able to update their information (email, password, and profile photo and the name and location as well) on the settings page of the app. The Homepage and the Login Page and the Register Page, and the Settings Page, as well as the Users Profile Page's UI and Themes, must be designed to be Minimalist. The Settings Page will Only Have the Email and Password Fields to update the users email and password, The Profile Tab Will Have all the Other Fields To Update The Rest of the User's Information. The Default values for the users name and location will be Null if the user does not enter them when they log in to the App For the First Time. Once the user enters their information it becomes saved and updated on their Profile. The App should Have an Authentication System and it should be fully Functional and Secure. The app should be fully working, The database must be fully linked with the python flask app and it should store the users data properly and securely. The App can store all the Users in one Database and one table. And The App will also be running on the default localhost 5000 as well and the app can run without any problems. The App Should display user-friendly error messages if the user enters the wrong username or password or when the user enters the wrong email format when registering or updating the email. This will improve the error handling in the app to make it a better experience where the user can easily debug if they encounter any errors with the app. The App should be fully debugged and there should be no errors running the app from the terminal or the command prompt. The name of the database can be users.db. The table name can be users. All the required Libraries must be imported no warnings on the terminal whatsoever. Also the Password Field Must be encrypted Using the Werkzeug Security Module. The Python Flask App will also not be allowed to give out any print statements on the terminal, all user messages should be displayed on the website itself. The App will also have a simple navigation bar at the top of the app which will have the Home, Settings, Profile, Logout and Login and Register Page to allow the users to navigate through the app much easier. There should be no more than Five Pages on the App, The Pages are: Home, Login, Register, Settings and Profile and also Users. The Users Page will Display all the users and a Search Bar to Search for a User by their name. The user can also click on a User That Appeared on the Search Result and it will take them to the Other User's Profile Page to View Their Profile. There should be a back button on the user profile page as well which allows for the user to navigate back to the previous page from the user profile. The CSS should also be embedded with the HTML. The App should be Fully Working and it should include all the mentioned features. The App is a Web Application, so it is a good idea to remember that the app needs to have the best User Experience possible on it. The App will be Built on the Flask Framework. This App is for the final example where it comprises of all the previous ideas to create a bigger project, so it must be fully functional and usable. The Web Application Must be Fully Functional and All the Features Must be Working In it With no Errors. Also the app should also validate the password to be strong with one capital letter and one number to enhance the security. Thank you for making the best app on the market üèÜüòä. The app should be called EcoMeditation and there should be a title for each page of the website as well (EcoMeditation-Login, EcoMeditation-Register, EcoMeditation-Home, EcoMeditation-Settings, EcoMeditation-Profile). And also once the user logs in the login and register links from the Nav Bar should Disappear and Only the Home, Settings, Profile, Users and Logout Button will Appear on the NavBar. And also only if the user is not logged in the Home, Settings, Profile, Users and Logout links will not appear. And the app will auto direct the user to the Login Page once they open the app and they are not logged in. And finally if the user logs out from the app, the app should direct them to the Login Page (EcoMeditation-Login). The App should also include a requirements.txt file, So there won't be any missing dependencies or issues that can come up from the python framework. The App should also include an App.py for the python code and all the HTML pages for the website. The HTML files can be Login.html, Register.html, Home.html, Settings.html, Profile.html and Users.html, The App Should also include a Models.py File This File will define the Database Model with an Object-Oriented Approach. This will make the app more organized and secure. Please make sure that this App is fully Functional and Works 100%. The app Should also have a favicon to make it more appealing to the user, and the app will have a search bar that the user can use to filter the users on the users.html page, This will make the app more user friendly with the search capability. And it should also only filter the users by name and the search result should be like if the user looks for john, it should give out results like johnny on the search as well so that all potential results will be shown, This will make it easier for the users to search other users to follow them."
