Operators can view historical data, generate efficiency reports, and integrate with grid management for smarter dispatch decisions. The system should be able to integrate with SCADA systems for real-time control of renewable assets. Implement a 'dust accumulation' monitoring feature for solar panels, recommending cleaning schedules. The system should provide 'wake effect' analysis for wind farms, optimizing turbine alignment based on prevailing wind directions and neighboring turbine interference. Include a 'power curve' analysis tool to compare actual vs. theoretical energy output based on environmental conditions. Predictive maintenance alerts should consider both environmental stressors and equipment health data. The dashboard should allow for 'what-if' simulations for different weather scenarios on energy production. Provide a 'component stress analysis' based on extreme weather events, helping to extend asset lifespan. The system should track carbon emission reductions achieved by the renewable energy site. Finally, integrate with energy market data to optimize dispatch strategies based on forecasted prices and weather-influenced supply.
