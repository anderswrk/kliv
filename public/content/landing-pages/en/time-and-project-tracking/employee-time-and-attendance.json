      "content": "## The pitfalls of general solutions\n\nStandard time and attendance software often presents significant challenges:\n\n- **Lack of flexibility:** They rarely align with specific company policies on overtime, breaks, or project codes.\n- **Unnecessary features:** You pay for complex modules you'll never use, increasing costs and complicating user experience.\n- **Integration headaches:** Struggle to connect with existing payroll, HR, or project management systems.\n- **Data ownership & security concerns:** Relying on third-party servers might pose data privacy risks for sensitive employee information.\n- **Limited reporting:** Generic reports often don't provide the granular insights your business needs for efficiency and billing.\n\n## Why custom-built is the ultimate solution\n\nKliv transforms the way businesses approach their internal tools. Building a custom time and attendance system offers unparalleled benefits:\n\n### Perfect alignment with your policies\nDesign logic that accurately reflects your overtime rules, shift differentials, break policies, and specific project billing requirements.
