The platform's AI accelerates development, allowing you to focus on tailoring features rather than coding from scratch. More complex systems with deep integrations might take a couple of weeks to refine.",

        {
          "answer": "No coding is required. Kliv is designed for business owners and managers. You describe the functionality your spa or wellness center needs, and the AI guides you through the process, helping you build a robust application without writing a single line of code.",
          "question": "Do I need to be a developer or have coding knowledge?"
        },
        {
          "answer": "Yes, custom solutions built with Kliv can integrate with a wide range of external services like payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal), accounting software (QuickBooks), marketing platforms (Mailchimp), and more, often through their APIs. This ensures your new system works seamlessly with existing tools.",
