Off-the-shelf solutions come with limitations on design, features, and often hefty transaction fees that eat into valuable donations. Building a custom website empowers your organization to create a truly unique donor experience, directly reflecting your mission and maximizing every contribution.\n\nKliv's AI-powered platform makes custom web development accessible, allowing non-profits of any size to craft a digital presence that perfectly aligns with their goals, without needing extensive technical expertise or a large budget."
