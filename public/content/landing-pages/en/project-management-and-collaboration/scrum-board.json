      "content": "Off-the-shelf Scrum applications offer a one-size-fits-all solution that rarely fits any team perfectly. They often come with overwhelming features you don't need, lack critical functionalities you do, and force your agile practices into their predefined structures.\n\nThis leads to compromises in workflow, unnecessary complexity, and a tool that hinders rather than helps your team's agility. With Kliv, you can build a Scrum board that truly aligns with your team's rhythm and ritual."

      "title": "Why build a custom Scrum board?",
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "## Tailored to your agile methodology\n\nEvery agile team has its nuances. Whether you're strict Scrum, Scrumban, or a custom hybrid, a generic tool forces you to adapt. A custom board built on Kliv allows you to:\n\n- **Define your own columns**: Differentiate between 'In Progress - Frontend' and 'In Progress - Backend', or add specific 'Code Review' and 'QA Testing' stages.\n- **Custom card fields**: Add fields for story points, estimated hours, priority levels, dependencies, or links to technical specifications that are relevant to your projects.\n- **Workflow automation**: Implement custom rules for moving cards, notifying team members, or updating status based on your unique definitions of 'done'.\n\n## Unmatched flexibility and control\n\nStandard tools often dictate limitations on reporting, integrations, and user permissions. With your own custom Scrum board, you gain:\n\n- **Granular permissions**: Control who can view, edit, or move cards at a much finer level than off-the-shelf solutions typically allow.\n- **Specific integrations**: Connect directly with your code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, customer support systems, or internal communication tools without needing complex workarounds.\n- **Data ownership & analytics**: Keep your project data exactly where you want it. Build custom dashboards and reports that highlight the metrics most crucial to your team's performance, not just predefined KPIs.\n\n## Cost-effectiveness in the long run\n\nSubscription fees for popular tools add up, especially as your team grows. A custom solution built with Kliv represents a one-time development investment that offers long-term savings, avoids per-user charges, and ensures you're paying only for features you actually use and value.\n\n## The Kliv advantage for agile teams\n\nKliv's AI-powered platform makes custom software development accessible. You describe your ideal Scrum process, and Kliv helps build the application. This means:\n\n- **Rapid iteration**: Quickly adjust your board's layout or features based on sprint retrospectives and evolving team needs.\n- **Scalability**: Easily add new projects, teams, or adjust for growth without hitting subscription tier limits.\n- **Future-proof**: As new agile practices emerge, your custom board can evolve with them, unlike rigid SaaS offerings."
