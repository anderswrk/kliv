      "content": "In a fluctuating market, tax-loss harvesting is a crucial strategy for investors to reduce their capital gains tax liability, thereby boosting after-tax returns. While some platforms offer generic solutions, a custom-built tool ensures precision, adherence to specific tax rules, and integration with your broader financial ecosystem.\n\nOff-the-shelf tools often come with limitations: they might not support all your brokerage accounts, lack detailed customization for your unique portfolio, or come with hefty subscription fees. Building your own allows for complete control, enhanced security, and a tailor-made approach to maximizing your tax savings."
