      "content": "## The challenges with off-the-shelf KYC solutions\n\nMany financial institutions rely on generic vendor solutions for digital account opening and KYC. While these might offer a quick start, they often come with significant drawbacks:\n\n- **Rigid workflows**: They force you to adapt your unique onboarding process to their pre-defined logic.\n- **Integration nightmares**: Connecting them seamlessly with your existing core banking systems, CRM, and risk engines can be complex and costly.\n- **Limited customization**: Tailoring the user interface or specific verification steps to your brand and customer segments is often difficult or impossible.\n- **Data sovereignty concerns**: You might lose control over sensitive customer data or face limitations on where it can be stored.\n- **Vendor lock-in & recurring costs**: Perpetual subscription fees and dependence on a single vendor for updates and support.\n- **Suboptimal user experience**: Generic solutions rarely offer the perfectly optimized, frictionless journey your customers expect.\n\n## The undeniable advantages of building your own\n\nLeveraging platforms like Kliv to build your own Digital Account Opening & KYC solution transforms these challenges into opportunities:\n\n### Perfect fit for your operations\nDesign onboarding flows that precisely match your business processes, regulatory requirements (e.g., AML, CFT), and risk models. Incorporate specific data points, document types, and verification methods unique to your products or customer segments.\n\n### Seamless integration with existing systems\nDevelop an application that speaks fluently with your core banking system, fraud detection tools, CRM, and data warehouses. This eliminates manual data entry, reduces errors, and provides a unified view of your customers.\n\n### Enhanced customer experience\nCraft an intuitive, branded, and frictionless onboarding journey. From intelligent form autofill to real-time status updates and customized communication, a tailored solution delights customers and reduces abandonment rates.\n\n### Full control over data & security\nHost the application and data in your own secure environment, ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and internal security policies. You dictate encryption, access controls, and auditing.\n\n### Cost efficiency & long-term value\nShift from recurring subscription fees to a one-time build investment. While there are ongoing maintenance costs, you gain full ownership and the ability to evolve the platform without vendor constraints, leading to significant long-term savings.\n\n### Agility & future-proofing\nQuickly adapt to new regulations, integrate emerging technologies (e.g., advanced biometrics, AI-driven risk scoring), or launch new products without waiting for vendor updates or paying for costly custom development add-ons.\n\n## Real-world impact\n\nCustom Digital Account Opening & KYC platforms are empowering financial institutions to:\n\n- **Reduce onboarding time**: From days to minutes, significantly improving customer satisfaction.\n- **Lower operational costs**: By automating manual reviews and reducing human error.\n- **Improve compliance accuracy**: With built-in rules engines and automated document verification.\n- **Increase conversion rates**: Through a smoother, more engaging user experience.\n- **Enhance fraud prevention**: By integrating advanced verification techniques and real-time risk assessment."

          "title": "Retail Banking Account Opening (Individual KYC) platform with document verification and liveness checks for national ID and passport, integrated with a credit check API and core banking system for new account creation. Must support multiple languages and send real-time status updates via email/SMS. Also include a 'save and resume' feature for unfinished applications, and an admin dashboard to review pending applications and audit trails for compliance, along with a customisable rule engine for automated decision making based on KYC results and credit scores, and an API for external systems to query customer risk profiles. Include a secure document storage module with version control and audit logs. The system should automatically flag high-risk applications for manual review and provide reasons for the flag. Implement a robust anti-fraud module that includes IP address checks, device fingerprinting, and transactional behavior monitoring during the application process to detect suspicious activities and notify relevant teams for immediate investigation. Additionally, integrate with an external PEP/Sanctions screening database to ensure that applicants are not on any watchlists. The platform should also provide an audit log for every action performed on the system, for regulatory compliance and internal review. Lastly, the platform should be able to generate comprehensive compliance reports daily or on-demand, detailing KYC metrics, decision outcomes, and audit trails for regulatory submission. Include a customizable workflow editor for financial institutions to define their own branching logic for different product types or customer segments, ensuring maximum flexibility. Ensure all data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard protocols, and implement role-based access control for all internal users to ensure data security and prevent unauthorized access. The system must also be scalable to handle thousands of concurrent applications without degradation in performance. Finally, provide robust error handling and logging capabilities to quickly identify and resolve any issues during the onboarding process. The system should also include an internal messaging system between compliance officers and applicants for clarification on documents or information. Provide comprehensive API documentation for all exposed endpoints so that external systems can easily integrate with the platform for seamless data exchange. Also, implement a callback mechanism to notify external systems upon completion of an application or a status change. The platform needs to use AI to intelligently extract data from submitted documents and cross-reference it with third-party databases, reducing manual review efforts and enhancing accuracy. The UI should be user-friendly with clear progress indicators, validation messages, and document upload guidelines to guide applicants through the process. The platform must also capture consent for data usage and terms and conditions digitally with robust audit trails for legal compliance. Real-time identity verification using video calls or advanced selfie matching should be an option for enhanced security. For cross-border applications, the system should be adaptable to different jurisdictional KYC requirements and data residency laws. The system needs to be cloud-agnostic with support for multi-cloud deployments for disaster recovery and scalability. Finally, a built-in notification engine needs to send automated alerts for application status changes, pending actions, and document expiry reminders to applicants and internal teams. Also, implement a webhook system to trigger external systems upon specific events, like application submission or status change, enabling real-time process orchestration throughout the ecosystem. The platform should also contain a robust case management system for flagged applications, allowing compliance officers to manage, track, and resolve exceptions efficiently. The KYC module needs to perform continuous monitoring of customer risk profiles post-onboarding, triggering re-KYC processes when certain risk factors change or after a defined period, ensuring ongoing compliance. Provide a comprehensive analytics dashboard for management, showing key performance indicators like application conversion rates, average processing time, and KYC pass rates, allowing for continuous optimization of the onboarding funnel. This platform should use blockchain for tamper-proof storage of KYC data and audit trails, ensuring data integrity and enhanced security. It should also support multiple international identification document types and leverage AI for advanced fraud detection by analyzing patterns in application data and social media insights. Provide a customizable API for integrating with different biometrics providers for fingerprint or facial recognition during the onboarding process to enhance security and user convenience."

The system must support document collection for Articles of Incorporation, financial statements, and shareholder agreements, with OCR for data extraction. The platform should also be capable of generating a clear corporate hierarchy tree for complex ownership structures, facilitating compliance reviews. Additionally, it must allow for the onboarding of various business types (e.g., sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, trusts, non-profits), each with specific KYC requirements and document checklists. Provide a secure portal for corporate clients to upload documents and track application progress, reducing back-and-forth communication, and include a collaborative review feature for internal teams to add comments and share insights during the due diligence process. Implement a risk scoring module that assesses the entity's industry, jurisdiction, and ownership structure to assign a dynamic risk rating. The system should also support ongoing monitoring of corporate entities for changes in ownership, directorship, or regulatory status, triggering alerts for re-KYC or enhanced due diligence when necessary. Provide a comprehensive reporting suite for audits and regulatory submissions, detailing the entire corporate onboarding journey and compliance checks. The platform should also integrate with an external data provider for real-time validation of company registration numbers and tax IDs to ensure authenticity."

It must also provide mechanisms for collecting proof of source of funds/wealth for high-value transactions, supporting various document types and secure upload. The system should incorporate a robust risk-based approach to adjust verification levels based on transaction volume, user behavior, and geographic location. The platform needs to comply with global AML/CFT regulations specific to virtual assets, such as FATF Travel Rule, and include a mechanism for automated reporting of suspicious transaction reports (STRs) to regulatory bodies. Provide a customizable framework for defining risk thresholds and triggers for enhanced due diligence, ensuring flexibility for evolving market conditions and regulatory changes. The system should also support ongoing behavioral analysis of user accounts to detect unusual trading patterns or withdrawal activities that might indicate illicit activities, notifying risk teams.

It must provide a self-service portal for existing customers to update their information and re-submit documents, with automated validation. The platform should compare updated information against existing records and flag discrepancies for review, streamlining the process. Integrate with external databases for real-time checks on updated customer data, such as adverse media screenings or PEP/Sanctions list updates, ensuring continuous compliance. The system needs to intelligently batch re-KYC requests to optimize workload for compliance teams and provide a clear dashboard showing the status of all ongoing re-KYC processes. Implement an escalation matrix for uncompleted re-KYC requests, notifying customers and internal teams for timely resolution. Provide an audit trail for every re-KYC action, including communications with the customer and review decisions, for regulatory scrutiny. The platform must also support different re-KYC workflows based on the customer's risk level, allowing for a more tailored and efficient process for low-risk clients, and enhanced due diligence for high-risk ones."
