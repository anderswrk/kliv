      "content": "## The limitations of generic solutions\n\nMany businesses struggle with standard time tracking tools because they are designed for a broad audience, leading to:\n\n- **Irrelevant features**: Cluttered interfaces with unnecessary functionalities.\n- **Missing nuances**: Inability to track specific metrics critical to your industry or unique project types.\n- **Integration friction**: Poor compatibility with your existing accounting, CRM, or project management software.\n- **Subscription bloat**: Escalating costs for features that aren't fully utilized.\n\n## Why a custom solution delivers more\n\nA tailored time and project tracking application built with Kliv offers unparalleled advantages:\n\n### Perfect alignment with your methods\nYour business isn't generic, so why should your tools be? A custom solution captures the exact data points you need, organizes projects the way you envision, and supports your unique billing cycles and reporting requirements.\n\n### Data ownership and security\nWith your own application, you maintain complete control over sensitive project and payroll data. There are no third-party servers to worry about, reducing security risks and ensuring compliance with your internal policies.\n\n### Cost-effectiveness over time\nWhile a custom build is an initial investment, it eliminates recurring subscription fees that can quickly add up.
