However, off-the-shelf survey tools often come with limitations: rigid templates, branded interfaces you can't remove, restrictive pricing models, and limited integration capabilities. They might force you to compromise on your data ownership or how you interact with respondents.\n\nWith Kliv, you can create a custom survey and feedback platform that aligns precisely with your brand, processes, and unique data requirements. Imagine a system where you control every pixel, every data point, and every report—built efficiently with AI assistance."
