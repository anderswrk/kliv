          "title": "IT Asset & Software License Tracker (ITAM/SAM) with procurement integration & renewal reminders, plus user assignment and audit logs for compliance reporting (e.g. for software audits, compliance, or end-of-life hardware refresh schedules). Include custom fields for hardware specs, purchase dates, warranty info, and license keys for software. Allow for check-in/check-out of portable assets like laptops or projectors to specific employees and generate automated alerts for upcoming software license renewals or hardware warranty expirations. Integrate with an LDAP directory for user lookup.. Generate a 'disposed' status for assets that have been retired, including disposal date and method, plus a report for auditors. Allow uploading of invoices and other related documents for each asset. Build an admin dashboard that gives a quick overview of total assets, those currently checked out, and upcoming renewals. Include a system for generating QR codes for each physical asset for quick lookup using a mobile app. The mobile app should support scanning QR codes to quickly view or update asset details and check assets in/out. Enable maintenance logs for each piece of hardware, allowing technicians to record service performed, dates, and associated costs. A history of these logs should be viewable per asset. Allow technicians to update asset status (e.g., 'In Repair', 'Available', 'Deployed'). An alert system should notify IT staff when an asset's lease is nearing expiration (e.g. 90 days out, 60 days out, 30 days out) or if an asset has been 'In Repair' for more than 7 days. Include a feature for users to request new hardware/software, which then goes through an approval workflow. If approved, it automatically updates inventory upon procurement. Generate a quarterly report summarizing asset purchases, disposals, and total value by department. Allow for filtering assets by various criteria such as location, department, user, and status. It should also include a role-based access control system to define what different user groups (e.g., IT Admin, Department Head, End User) can view and modify. Log all significant changes to asset records, including who made the change and when, for audit purposes. Finally, integrate with a single sign-on (SSO) solution for user authentication. The system should also notify specific users (e.g., department heads, finance) when an asset is nearing its end-of-life based on a predetermined timeline for depreciation or usage. It needs to track expenses associated with each asset beyond initial purchase, such as maintenance costs, repair costs, and software subscription fees, and integrate this with a general ledger for depreciation and balance sheet reporting. Furthermore, implement an alert system when an asset's status changes from 'Deployed' to 'Available', so that it can be reassigned or prepared for a new user. The system needs to keep track of the physical location of assets and allow for auditing asset locations periodically, with discrepancies reported. A 'parts inventory' section should allow tracking of components used for repairs or upgrades, deducting them from stock when used on a specific asset's maintenance log. It should also have a dashboard showing assets by their remaining useful life. For software licenses, track the number of available seats versus those deployed and alert when nearing maximum capacity. Create a vendor management section to store vendor contact info, support contracts associated with assets, and renewal dates, ensuring no contract lapses unnoticed. Finally, it should support bulk import and export of asset data via CSV or Excel for initial setup and mass updates. The system should automatically generate a unique ID for each asset upon creation, along with an option to manually assign an existing asset tag. Allow for photos or scans of receipts/documentation to be attached to each asset record and for custom fields to be defined by administrators for specific asset types that have unique needs not covered by the default fields. Provide a robust search functionality that allows users to quickly find assets by asset ID, serial number, user, location, or any custom field. The system needs to log changes to asset ownership or location, establishing a clear chain of custody. It should also highlight assets that are overdue for maintenance based on predefined schedules. Implement a reservation system for shared assets, allowing users to book items for specific periods and view availability. The system should also generate reports on total cost of ownership (TCO) for specified asset types over their lifespan. Track all assets from purchase order to disposal, providing a full lifecycle audit trail. Allow for mass updates of asset properties (e.g., changing location for multiple assets at once during an office move). Enable the creation of asset bundles, e.g., a workstation setup including monitor, keyboard, mouse, and CPU, to be deployed as a single unit but tracked individually. Support for mobile device management (MDM) integration to pull data directly for mobile assets is also desired. Lastly, the system should allow for the depreciation of assets based on various accounting methods (e.g., straight-line, declining balance) and integrate these calculations into financial reports directly. Allow for multi-currency support in asset valuation and procurement costs if assets are sourced internationally. It needs to provide a visual representation of asset distribution across different locations or departments, like a heat map on a floor plan. The system should support multi-tenancy if we want to manage assets for different internal departments or external clients, segmenting data access appropriately. Implement a 'wishlist' feature for departments to request new assets which can then be used by procurement for budgeting and planning. Finally, provide integration with endpoint management tools to automatically update software versions or push configurations to deployed IT assets. Additionally, the system must allow for the linking of related assets, e.g., a server to its installed drives or network cards, forming a hierarchy. It should also track the physical condition of assets over time, using a rating system or condition notes, to inform replacement decisions. The system needs to generate alerts for compliance with software license agreements if usage exceeds licensed capacity. Support includes creating custom asset types with unique fields and associated workflows (e.g., for vehicles, different fields would track mileage, fuel type, etc.). It should also facilitate the transfer of assets between locations or departments, with an auditable transfer record and digital signature capture for accountability. The system needs to support the integration of IoT sensors for real-time tracking of location, temperature, or usage metrics for certain assets. Allow for the creation of preventative maintenance schedules based on time or usage, automatically generating work orders and assigning them to technicians. Finally, it should have a built-in messaging or notification system for communicating asset status changes or maintenance alerts to relevant personnel directly within the application. The system should have an 'archive' function for inactive assets that are not yet disposed of, but no longer in active use, maintaining their history but removing them from active reports. It should also support multiple languages for user interface and reports. Additionally, the system needs to include a comprehensive document management system for storing manuals, warranties, and compliance certificates linked directly to each asset. Finally, provide a mobile view optimized for scanning and quick updates, allowing field personnel to manage assets on the go, even offline with eventual sync. The system should also allow for generation of QR codes/barcodes for physical assets directly from the application and support printing, ensuring easy identification and tracking. It needs to include a vendor performance tracking module based on asset procurement and maintenance history. Allow for batch updating of asset information, for instance, updating the status of multiple assets simultaneously after an inventory audit. The system should also have a 'loaner' module for temporary asset assignments with automated return reminders. Include a feature to manage asset depreciation schedules and integrate this with financial reporting, including different depreciation methods (e.g., straight-line, declining balance, sum-of-the-years' digits). Implement automated status changes for assets based on their activity (e.g., an asset checked out for 30 days automatically flags as 'Overdue'). The system needs to track the full cost of ownership for each asset, including purchase price, maintenance, upgrades, and disposal costs. Provide an interactive dashboard with real-time graphs showing asset distribution, status, and value depreciation over time. Ensure the system is compliant with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) for any personal data stored regarding asset users. It should also include a powerful reporting engine with flexible filters and export options in various formats (PDF, Excel, CSV). Lastly, the system needs to support integration with single sign-on (SSO) and LDAP/Active Directory for secure user authentication and streamlined user management. The system should also provide an audit trail for all changes made to asset records, including who made the change, when, and the old/new values, ensuring full accountability. Allow for customizable email or in-app notifications for various events like overdue check-ins, upcoming maintenance, or new asset requests. Implement a hierarchical location structure (e.g., Building > Floor > Room) for precise asset placement tracking. The system needs to support multi-level approval workflows for asset requests, transfers, or disposals. Provide a centralized dashboard for IT managers to monitor all IT assets, their health, performance, and compliance status. The system should allow for associating assets with specific projects or cost centers for better financial allocation and reporting. Finally, allow for the attachment of service contracts and warranty information directly to assets for quick reference during repairs or claims. The system should also notify users when assets they are responsible for are due for return or maintenance. It needs to track software license compliance and alert if installed software instances exceed licensed limits. Additionally, provide a 'snapshot' feature to record current inventory levels at a specific date for reconciliation purposes. The system should also support custom reporting based on any combination of fields and criteria. Implement a 'quick search' bar across the entire application for fast lookup of any asset. It needs to support a 'parent-child' relationship for assets, e.g., a server rack being a parent to multiple servers. Finally, provide a mechanism for users to report asset issues directly within the system, automatically generating a work order for the IT team. The system should allow for the management of serialized and non-serialized inventory items within the same framework. It needs the ability to perform physical inventory counts using mobile devices and compare against system records, highlighting discrepancies. Additionally, the system should allow for the scheduling of automated reports to be sent to stakeholders via email at predefined intervals. Provide a 'kitting' feature to bundle multiple inventory items into a single kit for simplified issuance and tracking. The system should also support multi-currency and multi-warehouse inventory management. Finally, facilitate integration with shipping carriers for automated tracking of outgoing or incoming inventory items. The system should also have a dashboard showing total inventory value, broken down by category or location. It needs to support lot and serial number tracking for specific inventory items, crucial for recalls or warranty management. Additionally, the system should allow for the creation of stock movement logs, detailing all ins and outs of inventory. Implement min/max stock level alerts for inventory items to trigger reorder processes automatically. The system needs to provide comprehensive audit trails for all inventory transactions, including user, date, and changes made. Finally, allow for the grouping of inventory items by custom categories or tags for flexible organization and reporting. The system should also provide visual aids like floor plans or warehouse layouts to pinpoint asset locations. It needs to support cross-docking operations for inventory, minimizing storage time. Additionally, the system should have a 'cycle counting' feature to periodically verify inventory accuracy without shutting down operations. Provide a vendor portal for suppliers to view purchase orders and update delivery statuses. The system should also generate predicted demand forecasts for inventory based on historical data and seasonality. Finally, allow for the management and tracking of consumables alongside durable assets. The system should also support integration with barcode scanners for efficient data entry and verification in inventory processes. It needs to provide a clear overview of asset availability and utilization rates to optimize resource allocation. Additionally, the system should include a feature for managing repair history and costs for maintainable assets. Provide an alert system for assets nearing condemnation or disposal based on age or condition. The system should also support the management of digital assets, such as software licenses or digital media files, within the same framework as physical assets. Finally, implement a robust reporting module that can generate custom reports on asset value, depreciation, and utilization. The system should also allow for tracking of leased assets, including lease terms, end dates, and lessor information. It needs to support Geofencing for location-based tracking and alerts for assets moving outside designated areas. Additionally, the system should include a feature for managing returns and exchanges of inventory items. Provide functionality for tracking individual components within a larger asset (e.g., engine in a vehicle). The system should also allow for automated updates of asset information from integrated external sources, like manufacturer databases. Finally, extend the reporting capabilities to include predictive analytics on asset failure rates or replacement cycles. The system should also implement a 'reservation' system for shared assets, allowing users to book and schedule usage. It needs to provide a 'repair' module to manage external and internal repair processes for assets, including linking to vendor service requests. Additionally, the system should include a comprehensive set of APIs to allow seamless integration with other business applications. Provide a 'dashboard' view customizable by user role, displaying key metrics relevant to their functions. The system should also support multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security. Finally, allow for the generation of custom labels and tags for physical assets directly from the system. The system should also support offline access for field teams to manage assets in remote locations, with data syncing once connectivity is restored. It needs to provide a visual timeline for each asset's history, showing all changes, maintenance, and transfers. Additionally, the system should integrate with popular mapping services to visualize asset locations. Provide a 'cost center' allocation feature to distribute asset costs across different departments or projects. The system should also implement a 'workflow engine' to define and automate business processes related to asset management, such as approval flows for asset requests. Finally, allow for the attachment of various document types (e.g., PDFs, images, spreadsheets) to asset records. The system should also support the tracking of non-capitalized assets and consumables. It needs to provide an intuitive user interface for both desktop and mobile access. Additionally, the system should include a robust search and filter mechanism across all asset data. Provide customizable dashboards with widgets showing key performance indicators (KPIs) like asset utilization, maintenance costs, and asset depreciation. The system should also integrate with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems for comprehensive financial management.
