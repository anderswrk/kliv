Generic Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools often come with a steep learning curve, unnecessary features, and rigid structures that don’t align with your unique client-centric processes. They force you to adapt your business to their software, rather than the other way around. \n\nThe answer isn't another subscription to an imperfect tool. It's building a custom client management system that truly reflects how you interact with your clients and delivers precisely what your business needs. With Kliv, this powerful customization is finally within reach."
