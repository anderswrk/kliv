They can be rigid, expensive, and lack the specific analytical depth or integration capabilities your unique business demands. With AI-powered development platforms like Kliv, building custom data science and BI applications is no longer an undertaking reserved for large enterprises with vast IT budgets.\n\nOff-the-shelf BI tools often come with limitations on data connectors, visualization types, and the complexity of analytical models you can run. Custom-built solutions, however, provide precise control over your data pipelines, analytical logic, and presentation layers, ensuring your insights are perfectly tailored to your strategic needs."
