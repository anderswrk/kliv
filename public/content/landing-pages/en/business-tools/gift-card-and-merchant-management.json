For businesses that operate with multiple merchants, or require specific redemption rules, a custom system is a game-changer.\n\nWith Kliv's AI-powered platform, you can design a system that precisely fits your operational needs, offering unparalleled flexibility, cost efficiency, and full control over your gift card program and merchant network. No more adapting your business to software; build software that adapts to your business."
