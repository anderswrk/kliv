      "content": "Off-the-shelf HR and payroll systems often fall short when your team includes both salaried employees and commission-based workers. These systems rarely offer the flexibility needed for diverse compensation structures, detailed performance tracking, or custom reporting.\n\nBuilding your own management solution means you don't have to compromise. You get a system that perfectly reflects how your business operates, how you compensate your team, and how you track their success. This level of customization ensures accuracy, reduces manual effort, and scales with your unique growth."

      "content": "## The limitations of generic solutions\n\nExisting HR, CRM, or accounting software often struggle with the nuances of managing both traditional employees and performance-driven, commission-based workers. You'll often find yourself:\n\n- **Manually calculating commissions** due to rigid payout structures\n- **Struggling to track individual performance** against diverse goals\n- **Maintaining separate systems** for different types of workers\n- **Lacking integrated views** of team productivity and costs\n- **Paying for features** you don't need while missing crucial ones\n\n## Custom-built: Designed for your success\n\nWith Kliv, you can design a system that precisely addresses your operational realities, enhancing efficiency and accuracy across your entire workforce.\n\n### Unified Workforce View\nGain a single source of truth for all your team members, regardless of their employment type. Link performance, attendance, and compensation data seamlessly.\n\n### Precision Commission Calculation\nCreate highly specific commission rules based on sales volume, profit margins, tiered rates, team overrides, or any other metric unique to your business. Eliminate spreadsheet errors and automate payouts.\n\n### Granular Performance Tracking\nDefine and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to each role, whether it's sales quotas for a commission-based agent or project milestones for a salaried employee. Generate custom reports to identify top performers and areas for improvement.\n\n### Scalable and Adaptable\nYour business evolves, and so should your tools. A custom system can easily adapt to new compensation plans, team structures, and reporting requirements without expensive upgrades or vendor lock-in.\n\n### Data Security and Ownership\nKeep your sensitive HR and payroll data secure within your own infrastructure. You control access, compliance, and data privacy, reducing reliance on third-party security protocols.\n\n## Real-world impact\n\nCustom workforce management systems are transforming how businesses operate:\n\n**Sales Organizations**: Automate complex commission calculations for hundreds of sales reps, track quotas, and provide real-time performance dashboards.\n\n**Real Estate Agencies**: Manage agent profiles, property listings, commission splits, and transaction histories, linking directly to deal closures.\n\n**Service Businesses**: Track hourly employee shifts, manage client project assignments, and integrate with customer feedback for performance reviews.\n\n**Franchise Operations**: Standardize new hire onboarding, enforce consistent training modules, and track performance across multiple locations.\n\n## AI-powered efficiency\n\nKliv leverages AI to make custom software development accessible and fast:\n\n- **Intuitive Design**: Describe your needs in natural language, and let AI build the foundational structure.\n- **Rapid Feature Generation**: Quickly add modules for time tracking, expense reporting, or performance reviews with AI assistance.\n- **Intelligent Data Mapping**: AI helps connect different data points (e.g., sales data to commission rules) efficiently.\n- **Automated Validation**: Ensure data integrity and calculation accuracy with AI-driven testing.\n\n## Start building your ideal system\n\nDon't settle for a system that almost fits. Build a workforce management solution that empowers your team, optimizes operations, and drives growth. With Kliv, you can create a robust, tailor-made system that grows with your business and precisely handles the complexities of your unique workforce."
