Generic event platforms often fall short, forcing compromises on branding, features, and flexibility.\n\nYou end up paying for features you don't use, lacking critical integrations, and struggling with designs that don't reflect your unique event. Kliv empowers you to build precisely the event website you envision, without the limitations."

      "title": "Why build a custom event and conference platform?",
      "type": "markdown",
      "content": "## Beyond basic event pages\n\nMost off-the-shelf event platforms offer a one-size-fits-all solution that never truly fits. They come with pre-defined templates, limited customization options, and often excessive transaction fees. This approach can lead to a disjointed user experience and hidden costs.\n\n### Unparalleled branding & user experience\nYour event's website is often the first touchpoint for attendees. A custom-built platform allows for pixel-perfect branding alignment, intuitive navigation, and a user experience tailored to your specific event type, whether it's a small workshop or a large international conference.\n\n### Complete control over data & integrations\nWith a custom solution, you own your attendee data. You can integrate directly with your CRM, email marketing tools, payment gateways, and other internal systems without relying on pre-built, often restrictive, connectors. This ensures data consistency and automates workflows.\n\n### Feature flexibility & scalability\nNeed a unique ticketing tier? Want to allow attendees to build personalized agendas? Or perhaps integrate live Q&A into virtual sessions? A custom platform lets you build exactly these features. As your event grows, your platform can scale seamlessly without forcing you into expensive enterprise plans.\n\n### Reduced long-term costs\nWhile an initial investment is required, building with Kliv can lead to significant long-term savings. You avoid recurring per-attendee fees, high transaction percentages, and costly upgrades for essential features that are standard in your custom build.\n\n### Real-world impact\n\nCustom event platforms are ideal for:\n\n-   **Annual industry conferences**: Offering complex multi-track agendas, speaker profiles, and networking features.\n-   **Educational workshops**: Providing specialized registration flows, pre-workshop materials access, and post-event resource hubs.\n-   **Concerts & festivals**: Managing tiered ticketing, interactive maps, and vendor marketplaces.\n-   **Corporate summits**: Ensuring secure access, personalized schedules for executives, and integrated feedback mechanisms.\n\n## The Kliv advantage for event organizers\n\nKliv leverages AI to make custom software development accessible for event professionals, even without coding experience. Describe the features you need in plain language, and Kliv helps you craft a robust, scalable, and beautiful event website, empowering you to:\n\n-   **Rapidly prototype**: See your ideas come to life quickly, enabling agile development based on your event's evolving needs.\n-   **Iterate and improve**: Easily modify features, add new sections, or adjust flows based on feedback or changing event requirements.\n-   **Focus on the event**: Spend less time wrestling with platform limitations and more time curating an exceptional event experience."
