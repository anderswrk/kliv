      "content": "## The deluge of digital information\n\nEvery day, professionals, researchers, and continuous learners are swamped with articles, reports, news feeds, and blog posts. The sheer volume makes it challenging to keep up, identify key takeaways, or even decide what's worth reading in full.\n\nGeneric summarizing tools often fall short because they:\n\n- **Lack deep customization**: Can't adjust summary length, focus on specific topics, or filter out jargon.\n- **Limit integrations**: Struggle to connect with your existing research, note-taking, or CRM systems.\n- **Raise privacy concerns**: You're often uploading sensitive information to third-party servers.\n- **Come with recurring costs**: Monthly fees for basic functionality that doesn't fully meet your niche requirements.\n\n## Why a custom-built solution is superior\n\nKliv empowers you to create a web summary tool that is perfectly aligned with your unique needs. This approach offers significant advantages:\n\n### Unparalleled customization\nDesign summary algorithms that prioritize specific information, exclude boilerplate, or even translate summaries into different languages. Control the output format, length, and style to match your preferences (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs, action items).\n\n### Seamless integration\nConnect your summarizer directly to your internal knowledge bases, CRM, project management tools, or research databases. Automatically pull articles from specific sources or push summaries to your personal archive or team collaboration platforms.\n\n### Data privacy and ownership\nWith your own tool, you control where your data resides and how it's processed. No third-party access to potentially sensitive research, competitive intelligence, or private articles.\n\n### Cost-effectiveness in the long run\nAvoid perpetual subscription fees. A custom solution is an asset you build and own, providing continuous value without ongoing, escalating costs.\n\n### Adaptive and evolving\nAs your information consumption habits or research needs change, you can easily modify, update, and add new features to your tool, ensuring it always remains relevant and effective.\n\n## Real-world applications of custom summarizers\n\nCustom web summary tools are incredibly versatile:\n\n**Journalism & Media**: Rapidly summarize news articles, press releases, and research for story development or competitive analysis.\n\n**Legal & Compliance**: Quickly distill long legal documents, case studies, or regulatory updates to grasp key points and implications.\n\n**Academic Research**: Accelerate literature reviews by summarizing research papers, theses, and journals for faster synthesis of information.\n\n**Business Intelligence**: Extract key insights from market reports, competitor analyses, and industry news without reading every word.\n\n**Content Curation**: Efficiently process large volumes of online content to identify valuable information for newsletters, social media, or internal team updates.\n\n## AI makes it accessible\n\nBuilding sophisticated AI tools used to be complex. Kliv's platform simplifies this, allowing you to:\n\n- **Describe your needs**: Use natural language to define how you want your summarizer to work.\n- **Visually design**: Drag and drop components to create the user interface and data flows.\n- **Benefit from smart suggestions**: AI helps optimize your summary models and user experience.\n- **Deploy rapidly**: Get your personalized tool up and running in days, not months.\n\nDon't settle for generic when you can have precision. Build your ideal web summary application with Kliv."

          "title": "Academic literature reviewer with emphasis control (e.g., methods, results, conclusion). Summarize a research paper, extracting key findings and methodology in bullet points. Allow the user to specify if they want to focus on experimental setup or results when summarizing scientific papers. Provide the summary as short, concise bullet points, focusing on methodology and conclusions only. Also, identify and extract any numerical data or statistics mentioned in the summary, presenting them separately. Finally, include the full citation of the paper if available in the text. Provide a confidence score for the extraction accuracy and highlight any ambiguities. Include an option to regenerate the summary if certain keywords or phrases are not included as per user input. Also, offer a feature to compare the summary with the full text, highlighting discrepancies. Make sure the summary is easy to read for a non-expert, clarifying any jargon. The tool should also be able to ingest PDFs and convert them to text before summarization. Incorporate a feature to track which papers have been summarized. Additionally, add a reminder for users to review the full paper for detail. Ensure the output includes a section for 'Further Questions' based on the summary. Incorporate a 'Save and Tag' button for easy archiving, allowing custom tags. The summarized text should be editable by the user for clarity or inclusion of personal notes prior to saving. Finally, the tool should output the summary in Markdown format for easy export and integration into other applications like Obsidian or Notion. The user should be able to input a URL of an article into the application. If the article is behind a paywall and the user has access, the tool will try to use the user's credentials to access and summarize. If it's a non-scientific article like a blog post, it should focus on main arguments and actionable insights. If the article is a local file (e.g. PDF or DOCX), the tool should take the file as an input. The output summary should also highlight new terms/concepts introduced in the document and provide a succinct definition sourced from the document itself or external knowledge bases. This will help users quickly grasp new domains. Provide a feature to extract key questions from the content rather than just a summary. This will enable users to generate discussion points or focus their further reading. Introduce multi-language support, allowing users to summarize content and receive summaries in different languages. Ensure that the quality of the summary is high across all supported languages. Add an advanced feature to detect the sentiment of the summarized text. This can be useful for quickly assessing the tone of a review or opinion piece. The output should include a sentiment score and a brief explanation (e.g., 'predominantly positive' or 'neutral'). Allow users to link related summarized documents, building a knowledge graph for a particular topic. This can help users see connections between different pieces of information. Provide an option to generate a summary suitable for different target audiences (e.g., expert, general public, executive brief). This would require adjusting the level of detail and complexity of the language in the summary. Add a collaborative feature where users can share their summaries and annotate them together. This is useful for research teams or study groups. Include a 'Key Takeaways' section that's separate from the main summary and provides 3-5 high-level actionable points from the text. This is great for quick decision-making. Integrate with popular note-taking apps (e.g., Evernote, OneNote, Google Keep) to directly push summaries and tags into the user's preferred knowledge management system. Develop a Chrome extension version for one-click summarization directly from a web page. The extension should also allow quick tagging and saving. Implement a summary version control system where users can view previous summaries of the same document and track changes or different summarization parameters used. This is useful for refining outputs over time. Allow users to define custom 'exclusion' lists: keywords, phrases, or sections they explicitly want to omit from summaries. This is useful for removing boilerplate or irrelevant sections. Incorporate a 'Question Answering' module where users can ask specific questions about the source text after summarization, and the tool will attempt to provide answers based on its understanding of the content. This goes beyond simple summarization and provides interactive engagement. Add a feature to highlight directly on the original text the sentences or paragraphs that contributed most to the summary. This allows users to quickly verify the summary and understand the source of information. Build a 'Summary Digest' feature, where the tool can summarize multiple related articles or documents on a single topic into a consolidated meta-summary, identifying common themes and unique perspectives. This is invaluable for comprehensive research. Develop a personalized 'Learning Path' suggestion based on summarized content. If a user frequently summarizes articles on a certain topic, the tool could recommend related articles, books, or online courses to deepen their understanding. Introduce a gamification element where users earn points or badges for summarizing articles, identifying key facts, or sharing high-quality summaries. This can encourage active engagement and learning. Create a secure, encrypted storage solution within the app for all summarized content. This gives users peace of mind about their data privacy. Offer an 'Interactive Summary Explorer' where users can click on summary points to reveal the corresponding section in the original document. This helps users quickly navigate to the source. Integrate with academic databases (e.g., JSTOR, PubMed, ResearchGate) to fetch articles directly for summarization, bypassing manual URL input. This streamlines the research process for academics. Implement an alert system that notifies users when new articles on their predefined topics of interest become available and provides an immediate summary. This keeps users updated without constant manual checking. Add a 'Bias Detection' feature that attempts to identify potential biases in the summarized text (e.g., political bias, corporate bias) and warns the user. This promotes critical thinking. Allow users to train the summarization model with their own feedback, indicating which summaries were most relevant or accurate. This personalized learning would improve future summaries over time."

Furthermore, extract public statements on future strategy, pricing models, and key partnerships. The output should be structured to easily compare data points between competitors. Include a section for 'Actionable Insights' relevant to a business strategy. Additionally, if the report mentions market trends, summarize those trends and their potential impact. Provide a feature to append this summary data directly into a pre-defined Excel or Google Sheet template for further analysis. Offer an option to integrate with CRM systems like Salesforce to automatically update competitor profiles.

If a user frequently summarizes articles on a certain topic, the tool could recommend related articles, books, or online courses to deepen their understanding. Introduce a gamification element where users earn points or badges for summarizing articles, identifying key facts, or sharing high-quality summaries. This can encourage active engagement and learning. Create a secure, encrypted storage solution within the app for all summarized content. This gives users peace of mind about their data privacy. Offer an 'Interactive Summary Explorer' where users can click on summary points to reveal the corresponding section in the original document. This helps users quickly navigate to the source. Integrate with academic databases (e.g., JSTOR, PubMed, ResearchGate) to fetch articles directly for summarization, bypassing manual URL input. This streamlines the research process for academics. Implement an alert system that notifies users when new articles on their predefined topics of interest become available and provides an immediate summary. This keeps users updated without constant manual checking. Add a 'Bias Detection' feature that attempts to identify potential biases in the summarized text (e.g., political bias, corporate bias) and warns the user. This promotes critical thinking. Allow users to train the summarization model with their own feedback, indicating which summaries were most relevant or accurate. This personalized learning would improve future summaries over time."
