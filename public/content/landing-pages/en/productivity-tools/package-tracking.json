      "content": "## The parcel problem\n\nWhether you're an avid online shopper, a small business managing inbound supplies, or just someone who wants to know when their new gadget arrives, dealing with multiple tracking numbers across different carrier websites (or subpar apps) is inefficient and prone to errors. \n\n**Common frustrations with existing solutions include:**\n\n- **Scattered information**: Having to visit UPS, FedEx, USPS, DHL, and more, just to find out where your parcels are.\n- **Limited notifications**: Missing critical updates like 'out for delivery' or 'delivered' because the app is too generic or restrictive.\n- **Cluttered interfaces**: Apps trying to do too much, obscuring the primary function of simple, effective tracking.\n- **Subscription paywalls**: Basic features locked behind recurring payments.\n- **Lack of consolidation**: No single, clean view of all your incoming and outgoing packages.\n\n## Why a custom solution is superior\n\nKliv empowers you to create a package tracking tool perfectly tailored to your needs. This isn't just about convenience; it's about efficiency, clarity, and control.\n\n### Single-pane-of-glass view\nImagine all your packages, regardless of carrier, displayed in one intuitive interface. Your custom tool can pull data from countless services and present it exactly how you want to see it.\n\n### Precision notifications\nGo beyond basic 'delivered' alerts. Set up notifications for 'out for delivery,' 'attempted delivery,' 'customs cleared,' or even delayed statuses. Get alerts via SMS, email, or app push notifications, configured to your preference.\n\n### Tailored for your use case\n\n- **Personal use**: For individual consumers, manage all your online purchases, gifts, and returns without hassle.\n- **Small business**: Track incoming supplies, customer returns, or outgoing orders to keep your operations smooth.\n- **E-commerce**: Provide a branded tracking experience for your customers, reducing 'where is my order?' inquiries.\n\n### No feature creep, no subscriptions\nBuild only the features you need. Avoid the bloat of general-purpose apps and the perpetual cost of monthly subscriptions. Your tool, your rules, your one-time investment.\n\n## The Kliv advantage in building tools\n\nKliv's platform accelerates development, turning your ideas into functional applications faster than ever. \n\n- **Natural Language Interaction**: Describe your desired features in plain English.\n- **Rapid Prototyping**: See your tracking tool take shape quickly.\n- **API Integration**: Easily connect with major carrier APIs for accurate tracking data.\n- **Scalability**: Your tool can grow with your tracking needs, from a few personal parcels to hundreds of business shipments."
