Generic, off-the-shelf solutions often fall short, struggling to adapt to unique compliance needs, specific workflows, or diverse file types within an organization. They might come with unnecessary features that clutter the interface or lack crucial functionalities you desperately need.\n\nBuilding your own document management system (DMS) with Kliv allows you to create a solution that integrates seamlessly with your existing processes, adheres to your exact security protocols, and provides only the features truly essential for your team. This means no more forcing your operations into someone else's box, no more paying for unused functionalities, and full control over your intellectual property."
