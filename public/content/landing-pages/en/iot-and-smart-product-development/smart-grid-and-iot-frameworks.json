      "content": "Building smart grid and IoT solutions often means cobbling together generic platforms that don't quite fit your complex energy infrastructure. Off-the-shelf systems come with limitations in scalability, data handling, and integration with legacy systems. The result is often a costly, inefficient patch-up rather than a truly intelligent network.\n\nKliv helps you bypass these compromises. By enabling you to create bespoke frameworks, you gain precise control over data collection, analysis, and distributed intelligence, ensuring your system evolves with your energy needs."
