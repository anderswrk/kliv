Whether you're a small business, a large enterprise, or a solopreneur, your inquiry system should be as unique as your customer interactions.\n\nBuilding your own custom contact form and inquiry management tool with Kliv allows you to design the exact data capture, routing, response, and reporting capabilities you require, without the limitations or recurring costs of third-party platforms."

But if it's just a static form that emails you, you're missing out on vital data and efficient processes. Custom forms and full inquiry management systems mean:\n\n*   **Richer data capture**: Ask precisely the questions you need, in the format that works for you.\n*   **Intelligent routing**: Direct inquiries to the right department or person instantly.\n*   **Automated responses**: Send personalized acknowledgments and follow-ups based on inquiry type.\n*   **Centralized tracking**: Never lose track of a lead or customer request.\n*   **Actionable insights**: Understand inquiry trends and improve your service.\n\n## Limitations of off-the-shelf solutions\n\nExisting form builders or CRM modules often come with significant drawbacks:\n\n*   **Rigid Templates**: You're often stuck within predefined fields and designs.\n*   **Limited Customization**: Adapting to specific workflows or branding is difficult or impossible.\n*   **Data Silos**: Information often remains isolated within the form tool, not integrated with your other systems.\n*   **Recurring Costs**: Monthly subscriptions add up, especially as your needs grow.\n*   **Generic Reporting**: Analytics might not provide the specific insights your business needs.\n\n## Benefits of building your own\n\nKliv empowers you to create custom inquiry solutions that provide:\n\n### Perfect Fit\nDesign forms that capture exactly the data you need, with logic and workflows that perfectly match your internal processes. From simple contact requests to complex support tickets or multi-step application forms.\n\n### Full Data Ownership\nYour customer data is yours. Store it where you want, manage it how you see fit, and ensure privacy and compliance on your terms.\n\n### Cost Efficiency\nAvoid endless subscription fees. Build once, deploy indefinitely, and only pay for your hosting, not for every 'feature add-on'.\n\n### Seamless Integration\nConnect your inquiry system directly with your existing CRM, email marketing tools, project management software, or any other API-enabled service.\n\n### Scalability & Agility\nEasily add new form fields, adjust workflows, or expand capabilities as your business evolves. No waiting for vendor updates or feature requests.\n\n## Real-world applications\n\nCustom inquiry systems built on platforms like Kliv redefine customer interaction:\n\n*   **E-commerce**: Custom return/refund request forms that automatically generate tickets, notify inventory, and trigger shipping labels.\n*   **Service Businesses**: Detailed consultation request forms that gather specific project requirements, pre-qualify leads, and auto-schedule discovery calls.\n*   **Education**: Admission inquiry forms with dynamic fields based on program interest, automatically routing to relevant faculty and sending prospectus PDFs.\n*   **Real Estate**: Property inquiry forms that collect specific preferences (bedrooms, budget, location) and automatically match prospects with suitable listings and agents.\n\nWith Kliv, leveraging AI, you can describe your ideal inquiry process in plain language, and the platform helps you build it, fast."

Store submissions in a database, allow admin to view, mark as resolved, and delete inquiries via a simple dashboard. Send email notification to admin upon new submission. Include fields for name, email, subject, message. Also include a 'source' field to track where the inquiry came from (e.g., Google, social media, direct). Inquiries should have a status. Allow admin user to respond by sending an email directly from the dashboard and updating the inquiry status. Store the email reply on the inquiry record. Add a \"notes\" field for private notes. Limit who can access the dashboard. Send an auto-reply email to the customer with a personalized message and confirmation number after they submit the inquiry. The system should also show the date and time of submission. Allow CSV export of all inquiries. Add search functionality for inquiries via keywords, date range, and status. Display total number of inquiries and total resolved vs. unresolved. Include a 'priority' field, with dropdown options to easily set/change priority in dashboard, and ability to filter inquiries by priority. Send an email notification if an inquiry remains 'unresolved' for more than 48 hours. Add ability to sort table data via clicking headers (date, priority, status, source etc.) Implement CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA to prevent spam submissions. Add a feature so that each submission generates a unique ticket ID. Also add ability to attach files to inquiry record. Also create a basic analytics dashboard to track submission volume over time and by source. And set a maximum message length for submissions."
