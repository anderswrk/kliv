But when you need true interactivity, dynamic multimedia elements, or custom user experiences, they quickly hit their limits. You're left wrestling with plugins, custom code, or frustrating performance issues.\n\nOff-the-shelf solutions mean compromises: cookie-cutter designs, limited customizability for complex interactions, and often poor performance with heavy media. Building your own interactive website with a platform like Kliv ensures your vision isn't constrained by someone else's template."
