      "content": "## The challenges of managing a restaurant workforce\n\nRestaurants face unique challenges in staff management, including high turnover, diverse roles, variable schedules, and the need for strict access control to sensitive systems (POS, inventory, ordering). Standard HR software often provides limited flexibility, leading to:\n\n- **Inefficient onboarding**: Manual setup of permissions for each new hire.\n- **Security risks**: Over-permissive access for certain roles, or difficulty revoking access quickly.\n- **Scheduling headaches**: Lack of integration with permissions and role-specific availability.\n- **Compliance gaps**: Difficulty tracking training, certifications, and required access.\n- **Scalability issues**: Growing pains when adding new locations or expanding operations.\n\n## Why a custom solution is a game-changer\n\nA tailored user and role management system addresses these pain points head-on, delivering significant benefits:\n\n### Granular control over access\nDefine specific permissions for every role – from kitchen porter to head chef, from cashier to general manager. Ensure staff only access what they need, reducing errors and enhancing security.\n\n### Streamlined operations\nAutomate user provisioning, de-provisioning, and role assignment. New hires can be set up in minutes, and changes in roles or departures handled instantly.\n\n### Enhanced security\nMinimize the risk of internal fraud or unauthorized access. Track who did what and when, ensuring accountability across your organization.\n\n### Improved compliance\nEasily manage required certifications, food safety training completion, and other compliance-related access restrictions directly within the system.\n\n### Scalability and flexibility\nAs your business evolves, your system can too. Add new roles, departments, or entire locations without migrating to new software or expensive upgrades. Your system grows with you.\n\n## Real-world applications in food service\n\nCustom user management systems are transforming how restaurants operate:\n\n**Quick Service Restaurants**: Define roles for cashiers, fry cooks, and shift leaders, each with specific POS and inventory access.\n\n**Fine Dining Establishments**: Manage front-of-house (sommelier, server, maître d') and back-of-house (chef, line cook, dishwasher) roles with distinct access to reservations, ordering, and inventory.\n\n**Catering Companies**: Assign temporary event staff specific time-limited access to event management software and client databases.\n\n**Multi-Location Chains**: Centralized user management that allows regional managers to define standardized roles and permissions across all their outlets, while still allowing local managers some flexibility.\n\n### The AI-powered development advantage\n\nBuilding custom software used to be complex and expensive. Kliv.dev’s AI platform changes this:\n\n- **Natural Language Input**: Describe your desired roles and permissions in plain English.\n- **Rapid Prototyping**: See a functional prototype of your user management system within hours.\n- **Intelligent Suggestions**: AI assists in identifying optimal role structures and permission hierarchies.\n- **Code Generation**: AI translates your requirements into robust, secure code.\n\nInvest in a user management system that works *for* your restaurant, not against it. With Kliv.dev, you can define your ideal staff operations and build it yourself."

          "title": "Basic staff directory with roles & contact info (internal use only) and assigned location for each staff member, as a mobile-friendly app without login or advanced features needed, for a single restaurant (no multi-location support initially). Staff should be able to view their own profile and edit their contact information only, without any login. This is just for a simple staff directory with no security until a next version, just to get an app out quickly. Managers can view and edit everyone's info. No passwords, no logins required for anyone right now. Just a list of names, roles, and a phone number, and restaurant location. This will be an internal tool visible to all from the app link, so it's not super sensitive. Assume all data can be public for now within the local network or private link. NO LOGIN YET. This is important to get just the database and list out first. No API calls or advanced integrations in this first step. Just the data input, storage, and display as a simple list. We are focusing on getting the initial data structure right and then we will add security and features later as separate steps. For each staff member, we also need to store their manager's name. And if they are a manager, we need to denote that. Employees cannot see manager names of other employees, only their own manager, and managers can see every employee's manager. Also add a filter where manager can filter by staff by location and by role, and by manager name who they report to. Add search bar too. Managers are stored as staff too, with a 'manager' role. Each staff member should have a 'reports_to' field which is a foreign key to another staff member's ID who is their manager. We don't need a separate manager table. Just add fields to the existing staff table for each new feature. Make the 'reports_to' field optional, because not everyone reports to someone directly (e.g. owners do not). For new hires, there might be no assigned manager yet. For now, let's keep all data public once the link is shared. No authentication required to get the app out quickly. We only have to manage the staff by locations. Staff will be working on location, so each staff member must have an assigned location. We need to define multiple locations (e.g. Downtown, Uptown, Airport), and assign each staff member to one location. Managers can filter staff by location. We will have a new table for locations with pre-defined location names. Staff table will have a foreign key to location ID. Staff cannot change their location, only manager can. Add a new field: `status` for staff: Active, On Leave, Terminated. Only managers can change status. Managers can filter staff by status. Add an option for each staff member to upload their profile photo, and for managers to upload staff photos. Photos should be visible in the staff list. Staff can see all photos, managers can upload/change all photos. We need to store staff start date, and their last day of employment (if applicable). Only managers can see/edit these dates. Other staff cannot see these dates except their own start date. For salary information, include salary, hourly pay rate, pay frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly). ONLY MANAGERS CAN SEE/EDIT THIS. Other staff cannot see salary information. We also need to store emergency contact information for each staff member for Managers only. Name and Phone number too. Add a field for 'Notes' about staff member for managers only. This could be free text for performance notes, disciplinary actions, etc. We need to keep a record of roles for each staff member with effective dates. A staff member can have multiple roles over time, and roles can change. We need a 'Roles' table with `role_name` (e.g., Server, Bartender, Kitchen Staff), and a `Staff_Roles` junction table with `staff_id`, `role_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`. Each staff member can have multiple active roles at any given time (e.g., Server and Trainer). Managers can add/edit roles and their start/end dates. Staff can only see their current active roles. "

Include a way to mark certifications (e.g., Food Handler’s Permit) with expiration dates. Managers can view and edit all data, staff can only view their own. No logins yet, link will be shared within organization. Managers can also filter staff by stations and skill levels. Add a feature to view available staff for a specific shift based on their assigned stations, skills, and availability data. The availability data is stored for staff and it's a fixed schedule (e.g. Mon 9-5, Tue 10-6). Include search bar for managers to search staff names too. Managers can also search by certification name and expiration date to flag upcoming expirations. Add emergency contact information for EACH staff member for managers only. Include Name and phone number. Also add 'Notes' field for managers about a staff member (free text for performance notes, disciplinary actions). Store staff start date, and their last day of employment (if applicable). These dates are for managers only. Add salary/hourly pay rate and pay frequency for managers only. Add a field for 'Status' for staff: Active, On Leave, Terminated. Only managers change 'Status'. Managers can filter staff by 'Status'. Each staff member should have assigned location, and manager can filter and assign location. Pre-defined location names (e.g. Downtown, Uptown). Staff cannot change their location, managers can.

Provide managers with a visual calendar view of the weekly schedule and allow bulk assignment of shifts. Build a separate user role for 'Shift Managers' who can only manage shifts for their assigned department/location. Staff can set their general availability (e.g., Mon 9-5, Tue 10-6) and specific unavailability for certain dates. Managers can override general availability for specific shifts but it should warn them. Also add a system where managers can communicate with staff within the shift module, e.g., send notifications about shift changes. Include message history. Managers can assign tasks to individual staff members within a shift. Staff can mark tasks as complete. Managers can track task completion status. No public access, only accessible via login where we have admin, manager, staff roles. "
