      "paragraph1": "Kliv is an AI-powered platform that enables anyone to build professional web applications through natural conversation. Founded in 2025, Kliv is transforming how people create digital products by eliminating traditional technical barriers.",
      "paragraph2": "Unlike traditional development tools that require coding knowledge, Kliv uses advanced AI to understand what users want to build and generates production-ready applications automatically. The platform includes complete backend infrastructure (database, authentication, file storage, email) so users can build real, fully-functional applications without managing servers or technical configuration.",
      "paragraph3": "Kliv serves entrepreneurs, small businesses, and creators worldwide who want to bring their ideas to life without hiring development teams or spending months learning to code. Applications built with Kliv are powered by industry-standard technologies including React, TypeScript, and modern cloud infrastructure."

      "founderAlt": "Anders Olsson, Founder of Kliv",
      "paragraph1": "I've always loved writing code. It's my type of creative work. Some people paint, some write music. I can't do either of those things well. But I can write code well. There's a real joy in taking basic logical building blocks and shape them into something useful and elegant.",
      "paragraph2": "That kind of deep, hands-on programming will always have a place. There will always be people who want a stick shift, even when most cars are automatic or EVs that don't even have gears to shift. There are still people who ride horses. Some subset of people will always be passionate about their particular interest even if it might no longer have the same economic value it once did.",
      "paragraph3": "The reality is: the bulk of routine software work is moving on. Most of it -- all the work that millions of engineers do every day that don't really require taste or creativity. Shifting data around, building CRUD interfaces -- is already better handled by machines. And that's fine. That's progress.",
      "paragraph4": "Kliv is my attempt to build for that future.",
      "paragraph5": "The role of the hands-on programmer is fading — not disappearing, but shifting and that's fine.",

Unlike the first generation of AI builders that generate everything in a single reply, Kliv works like a real developer - thinking through requirements, inspecting files, making iterative changes, and refining code step-by-step.",
      "paragraph2": "Watch as the AI reasons through your project, asks clarifying questions, and methodically builds your application. Perfect for rapid prototyping, entrepreneurs, and businesses who want professional applications without the technical complexity.",
      "paragraph3": "Start with a library of pre-built apps and websites or build from scratch - either way, you'll have a custom application in minutes. Your app gets free hosting on kliv.site from day one, with instant deployment and no configuration needed.",
      "paragraph4": "The built-in workspace lets you edit code directly, preview changes before publishing, and maintain complete revision history so you can roll back to any previous version. Connect to GitHub for source control when your team grows, or export your entire codebase anytime.",
      "paragraph5": "Every tool you need for professional app development is integrated into a single platform, from initial prototype through production deployment and ongoing updates. Kliv includes a fully integrated backend that gives every app database, authentication, and API capabilities out of the box."
